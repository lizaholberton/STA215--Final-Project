# STA215--Final-Project
This is my final project for STA-215, where my group and I completed an analysis of the demographics in the United States House of Representatives. In order to do so, we collected data on all 435 members of the house to explore potential relationships and patterns among different variables. By using statistical methods to analyze the data, we aim to identify trends or correlations that could provide insights into the factors influencing legislative behavior or representation. 

In order to do so, we used various statistical methods using collected data on race, gender, party, age, education, term, previous job, wealth, christain affiliation, abortion stance, gun policy,voting record, bills passed, and region for all 435 members of the House.

# Data
The data used for this analysis was collected for each of the 435 representatives, and included variables such as race, gender, party, age, education, term, previous job, wealth, christain affiliation, abortance stance, gun policy,voting record, bills passed, and region. 

Our data was gathered using online records from credible sources.
# Operationalization
In order to define how the abstract concepts of our variables will be measured and quantified in our study, we assigned numbers to each category within each qualitative variable. For example, to operationalize the concept of race, we assigned a number from 1-7 to each racial/ethnic categorty. For optimal clarity and accuracy in our analysis, we ensured that each category within its variable was mutually exclusive, which simplified both our data collection and interpretation. Below I have listed our operationalized variables and categories: 

Gender: Male, female, or “other”. Labeled 1, 2, and 3

Party: Republican, Democrat, or Independent. Labeled 1, 2, and 3

Age: Recorded in years, calculated from the date of birth to age in 2022.

Term: Measured as the number of completed terms (two years each) in the House.

Previous Job: Categorized as “Professionals” or “Non-professionals”. Was determined by our discretion.

Wealth: Net worth in millions.
